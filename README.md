# GymReviewer Frontend JS - README

GymReview Backend API Repo: https://github.com/emrichmp/gym_reviewer_backend

### The Problem
Hey! Let's say you want to find a gym but I don't know where to start? Or maybe you love/hate your gym and wanna leave a review? Or you just opened up a gym and want to have a place for people to rate it? If only there was an all in one place to do that :(...

### The Solution
... :D But there is! Welcome to GymReviewer! This app lets users do all that! It's a simple JS/Ruby based web app that lets users write ratings on gyms, create gyms and even has a search function to find one!!!

### To Get Started:
- First navigate to the repo linked above to get the backend API running. The instructions to get the API running are in the README.md of the repo. Next you'll want to fork and clone this repo and get it open on your preferred editor. Once opened, run "open index.html" and you should be good to go!

### Function:
- The purpose of this App is for people to go and create gym instances (if their gym ins't already there) and leave reviews on them. A gym has a name, description and location. Where as a review has a content and rating. This should help people see what others think of a specific gym!
